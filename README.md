# NASDAQ-Stock-Analysis

NASDAQ stock analysis by using plotly library in Python and using data from Yahoo Finance API.

meta.py will have .csv file example, unlike other stocks in the index to show that the analysis can be conducted with .csv file, but I recommend the use of live data for more accurate analysis.
